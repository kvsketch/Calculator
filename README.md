# Calculator
Calculator for The Odin Project
This verision of calculator I will attempt to use a constructor method of saving the current
and previous number of the calculator to hopefully simplify the logic of the code.
My first attempt was using an array to create a number and using a second array to store the numbers.  I found it increasingly bloated and confusing to add the necessary features of the calculator, and upon looking at other solutions I want to attempt to go more object and class based.  And while I will be using others methods, I will attempt to understand the "why" of their methods instead of just copying code.

I will start by changing my html to no longer have inline "onclick" interactions and soley use
data-type to sort my buttons as I have recently learned that this is possible.
